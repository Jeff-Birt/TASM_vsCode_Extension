Random 68HC11 program example

This is a bit of test code for a Motorola 68HC11 I wrote many years ago. It 
was written for the Motorola assembler originally and I dug it out to see what
it would take to convert it to TASM syntax. It was fairly easy to convert.

To build we need to tell TASM to create a .s19. This file format is similar 
to the Intel .hex format and was commonly used on 68HC11 program loaders.
