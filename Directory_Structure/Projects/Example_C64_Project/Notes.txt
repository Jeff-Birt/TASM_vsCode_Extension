Hello World for the C64 using TASM

We use TASM to create a .prg file for a Commodore 64. The first two bytes 
of a .prg file is the load address of teh program. The C64 also uses PETSCII
rather than ASCII so we have to include test as byte arrays. More notes include
program comments.

To build we need to tell TASM to create a contiguous binary file. That is it
needs to be binary output that starts at the starting address and ends at the
end address with all memory addresses filled. More notes in built.bat
