These are a few simple samples for the Sharp lh5801 processor
used on the Sharp PC-1500 (TRS-80 PC2)

To assemble a particular file un-remark the appropriate line
build.bat. FOr example here 'inA.lh5801.asm' will be the file assembled.
You can also choose to assemble the Sharp or Z*) syntax version
of each file by commenting/un-commenting the associated lines.
A BASIC loader for each program is given at the top of the file in the
remarks.
