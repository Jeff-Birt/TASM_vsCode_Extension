If you want to modify this extension yourself you will need to download the whole project from GitHub as well as install node.js. The steps are below.

First steps, only need to do once.

#1 - You must install Node.js. The program to build the extenion runs in it.

#2 - Open a node.js command prompt. I find I need to do 'run as admistrator', you may not.

#3 - Install VSCE which is the program that pacakges the extension. To do this open a Node.js command line and type: npm install -g vsce 

The general plan is to change to the directory your extension is in, and then packcage the extesnion. This will build the VSIX pacakge (extension) which can be installed locally (see bottom of page). If this were your extension, afer testing you could also publish it to the market place.

$ <- these are lines you type
# <- these lines are responses from node.js

From a node.js command prompt:

To build:
$ cd myExtension
$ vsce package
# myExtension.vsix generated

To publish:
$ vsce publish
# <publisherID>.myExtension published to VS Code Marketplace

Example:
cd C:\Users\me\mypath\TASM_vsCode_Extension
vsce package 

Tips:
If prompted with "A 'repository' field is missing from the 'package.json' manifest file. Do you want to continue?" Select Y. This builds a locally installable extesnion but it cannot be published to the market place. This prompt is a complaint about there being no repository, i.e. GitHub, for the icon image.

To install the extesnions locally, from within VS Code open the Extesnsions tab (Ctrl-Shft-X), click on the elipsis '...', select 'Install from VSIX...', navigate to the VSIX you just built.
